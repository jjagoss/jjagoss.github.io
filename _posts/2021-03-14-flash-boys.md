Although Michael Lewis has described how angry his 2014 book __Flashboys__ made the major Wall Street players it depicted, one can't help but get the impression from reading the book that Lewis himself is the perturbed party. Six years after explaining to America how the 2007-2008 financial crisis unwound in __The Big Short__, Lewis returns to Wall Street with this entry and the tagline "The Stock Market is Rigged." Putting up my own biases, I'll admit I agree with him, but this book loses some of Lewis' usual potency by overexplaning its key theme to the point one wonders if Lewis is frustrated not enough people got the key lesson of his 2008 work.

## The Stock Market is Rigged
__Flash Boys__ follows Brad Katsuyama, a Wall Street Trader from the Bank of Canada, as he discovers, agonizes over, attempts to solve, and temporarily succeeds against the rise of High Frequency Trading (HFT) and its toxic effects on the American stockmarket. The unfairness originates from a number of causes, but the eponymous Flash refers to Wall Street's race to the top for data processing speed, allowing a select few enlightened brokers and HFT's to run faster than their competitors. A key example of this is in order frontrunning, wherein a broker with a faster data connection will see a slower comppetitor's intent to buy a large number of shares, cut in front of them and buy the shares first, then immediately sell them to their competitor but now for a higher price. You can see immediately how this makes the game unfair and creates economic loss with the artificially higher price that the HFT pockets himself.

In following Katsuyama and his band of Wall Street revolutionaries, Lewis also describes bank-owned private stock exchanges called Darkpools, regulatory rules and norms that obviously favor brokers, banks, and exchanges over the actual investors, and the market incentives that make all of this rewarded and desireable.

I just gave you a brief explanation of what Lewis means when he says the market is rigged. Hopefully that was mostly cogent. My explanation lasted a couple paragraphs...Lewis' takes about 200 pages. Because once he's explained the key theme of how HFT is basically cheating he needs to explain it to you again.

And again.

And Again...

And again.

Don't get me wrong, Lewis is one of my favorite writers. His admiration for social scientists, programmers, traders, statisticians, and bureaucrats who can make the complex understandable is itself understandable because few writers are able to spin these complex real world systems into compelling narratives with protagonists, villains, tension, drama, denouement, you name it. It's proven out by his successfully adapting two of his best known titles--one about the statistics revolution in baseball, one about the 2007 financial crisis--into blockbuster movies.

But another reason Lewis is such a compelling writers normally is because he doesn't think his readers are dumb. But reading this book you really get the impression Lewis is frustrated with his readers, concerned the reader isn't paying enough attention, or both.

## Buy the Dip
Throughout the narrative of Katsuyama buildng IEX with his colleagues to right the market's wrongs and coerce major players like Goldman Sachs to do the right thing, Lewis repeatedly explains why what's happening is wrong. He does this through explicit recitation, all manner of metaphors and analogies, and repeated expletives as more characters step out of Plato's allegorical cave and realize they're being played.

Alongside that, the book opens and closes with a Russian programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, going to prison at Goldman Sach's order in what Lewis describes as a sham trial on charges that should not have been criminal but were. Lewis pointedly notes the irony that Aleynikov was the only Goldman employee to be arrested following the financial crisis and this stands out, both for its potency as well as how utterly disconnected this part of the narrative is from the rest of the book. Indeed the only intersection between the book's main characters and Aleynikov is in the final chapter where Lewis himself arranges a meeting and has Sergey explain to the main characters the nature of his imprisonment.

It's these repetitions, and somewhat disconnected allusions to 2008 that gave me the impression that Lewis surveyed the world after __The Big Short__ and was as astounded as the Occupy Movement that the Obama Administration did not take more legal action against the originators of the meltdown. Along with that, American consumption quickly rebounded--even though mortgages were more tightly regulated auto loan default rates soared in the mid and late 2010s--and financial protections like Dodd-Frank have already begun to weaken just over a decade later. One gets the impression Lewis was left wondering if anyone had read his book or if they'd seen the movie, did they get the point?

## To the Moon
For what it's worth, I don't disagree with Lewis. I think the recent Gamestop-Reddit media blitz proves Lewis right in two respects. First, ordinary day traders still believe they can beat hedge funds and professional brokers who themselves still believe they can outperform the market over the long run. Second, even though millions of Americnas watched the Big Short, it seems by the time it came to buy GME, most Americans didn't know or had forgotten what a Short was in financial terms.

I myself don't think I can beat the market. Every piece of economic and financial research I've read from Thaler to Investopedia had convinced me that trading individual stocks for short term game is little better (or perhaps worse) than placing a bet on your favorite sports team or sitting down at a Poker table. Vanguard's huge success alongside robo advisers that recommend it, is based on research that consistently shows investors cannot consistently beat the collective wisdom of the market and are much better off staking their bets to funds that index the market as a whole. Trusting the research, and being humble enough to admit I cannot consistently outmaneuver the collective knowledge of all other global investors, I fall in with Lewis' suspicion and at times disdain for Wall Street middlemen.

However, just because I agree with Lewis and believe I understand his frustrations, doesn't mean I can overlook the at times laborious nature of __Flash Boys__. Lewis is too good a writer elsewhere to get bogged down trying to spoon feed his readers and make sure they clean their plates. You'll see this in Lewis' ususal effortless synthesis of his characters' personal narratives, key events in American financial history, and their interactions with the global financial system. Lewis even manages to end a book about the stock market with an almost horror movie like quality. Just as a zombie might shoot its hand out of the earth at the end of the movie where we thought the heroes were safe, so too does Lewis himself crest a hill and discover that news of HFT's demise has been exagerrated.

So while I admire Lewis trying to look out for his readers, just like in the capitalist system he describes, his readers ultimately have to look out for themselves.
