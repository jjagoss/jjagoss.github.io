Hi! I see you've found my new website, it's still a work in progress, much like me!

### About me

#### The resume version
My background and the beginning of my career are in public policy analysis -- think statistics and economics applied to analyzing policy impacts. I love learning about different policy sectors so I chose to be a generalist quant and bounce around, getting to contribute to research on Higher Education and Workforce, Telecommunications and Broadband, Health and Human Services, and most recently California Criminal Justice. I embraced this work because public policy at any level can profoundly change people's lives and be an engine for good in the world. The analysis component attempts to present the most truthful and honest case on what a policy can be expected to do.

Since then I've detoured to tech for the time being and have become a Data Scientist. My hope is to learn and grow my skillset so I can eventually U Turn back to the Public or Nonprofit sector and continue on a course of altruism.

#### The less strctured, more inchoate version
As I said I love to learn and grow but I'm not especially strategic adn sometimes not very intentional about how I spent my time.

**Not Strategic:** I care about impact, but I don't follow a specific framework like Effective Altruism that would direct me towards a specific occupation or career trajectory. I run hard in a direction assuming my conviction and and tenacity will carry me where I need to go. This is probably not very smart.

**Not Intentional:** At times I feel I suffer from Zeno's Paradox -- before I do this I have to do that -- but before I do that first I have to learn this -- and so it goes. It could be laziness, could just be I prefer to know things rather than create them, though I've long been an optimizer in this way, wanting to know the _right_ way to do something rather than trying and failing at it.
